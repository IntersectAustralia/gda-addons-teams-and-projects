DESCRIPTION:
This is part of an add-on for GDA.
This is the webapp for oaiprovider.
It provides an OAI-PMH harvestable frontend to a Fedora Commons instance.

DEPENDENCIES:
oaiprovider.war can be obtained from http://www.fedora-commons.org/
see: http://www.fedora-commons.org/software/current/

BUILDING:
oaiprovider.war must be extracted to the root of the project
i.e. PROJECT_ROOT/oaiprovier/**

NOTES:
As this is an addon, it requires an appropriately configured Fedora Commons instance
(such as one set up for a GDA application) to function correctly.
